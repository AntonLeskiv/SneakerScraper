SneakerScraper is an open source software that consists on scraping sneaker's prices from top selling platforms such as Hypeboost, Sneakit, WeTheNew, StockX and Klekt with only submiting the sneaker's SKU.
At the moment it only support sneakers, so clothes,watches won't work properly.

This version is completly working if you use the software properly, but need some fixes about error handling in some sites. Update will be soon!
