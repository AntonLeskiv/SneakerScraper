# SneakerScraper Bot
SneakerScraper is an open source software that consists on scraping sneaker's prices from top selling platforms such as Hypeboost, Sneakit, WeTheNew, StockX and Klekt with only submiting the sneaker's SKU.

# Installation
Before start to use the bot you would need to install the necessary Python libraries, just open the source folder, open Console and write

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

# Configuration
Once requirements are installed, you need to configure the bot on ``config.json``, you must introduce all the data except __wethenew_token__ which is optional

# Hot to use 
You have two options to get the bot working, one is to get the prices on screen (console) , the second is using a discord bot which I recommend personaly

# Discord Comands
``!all {sku}`` --> Scrap all websites

``!k {sku}`` --> Scrap Klekt website

``!sx {sku}`` --> Scrap StockX website

``!s {sku}`` --> Scrap Sneakit website

``!w {sku}`` --> Scrap WetheNew website

``!h {sku}`` --> Scrap Hypeboost website

# Important 
This version is completly working if you use the software properly, but need some fixes about error handling in some sites. Update will be soon!
At the moment it only support sneakers, so clothes,watches won't work properly.
